/*
Protocol

For establishing the connection, see https://github.com/termux/termux-gui/blob/main/Protocol.md#connection . Here is the relevant part:

The program has to open 2 AF_UNIX SO_STREAM server sockets in the abstract linux namespace and listen to new connections.
One of these Sockets is used as the main communication socket with the plugin, the other one is used to send asynchronous event data to the program, eg. click events.

The program then has to send a broadcast to com.termux.gui/.GUIReceiver with the string extra mainSocket and the string extra eventSocket, the values of which specify the socket name used for that communication type. The names have to be transferred without the leading null byte required to specify the abstract linux namespace.
Delivering the broadcast can be easily done with the am command:
am broadcast --user 0 -n com.termux.gui/.GUIReceiver --es mainSocket mainSocketName --es eventSocket eventSocketName

For additional security, the program should check if the connected peer has the same user id as the program itself, to ensure only the plugin can accept the connection.



Each message is send delimited, that is the size of the message is send as a varint first.  
All protocol buffer implementations should allow you to read the varint or a delimited message directly.

Events are send via the Event message, with the oneof sent to the actual event.
Methods are called with the Method message, with the oneof set to the request you want to do.
After a request, the corresponding response is send back.
